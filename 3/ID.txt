1. PPS3S1Q1.cpp code shows cpp using expressions like "++i", "j++ > 2*i" in the loop:


    ++i will increment the value of i, and then return the incremented value.

     i = 1;
     j = ++i;
     (i is 2, j is 2)

    i++ will increment the value of i, but return the original value that i held before being incremented.

     i = 1;
     j = i++;
     (i is 2, j is 1)




2. PPS3S1Q3.cpp code shows cpp legimity of using "=" operator instead of "==", which can cause unexpected results. "=" in while condition expression returns false:
