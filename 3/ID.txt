1. PPS3S1Q1.cpp code shows cpp using expressions like "++i", "j++ > 2*i" in the loop:


    ++i will increment the value of i, and then return the incremented value.

     i = 1;
     j = ++i;
     (i is 2, j is 2)

    i++ will increment the value of i, but return the original value that i held before being incremented.

     i = 1;
     j = i++;
     (i is 2, j is 1)




2. PPS3S1Q3.cpp code shows cpp legimity of using "=" operator instead of "==", which can cause unexpected results. "=" in while condition expression returns false:

3. PPA02.cpp Effective using of loops and math operators, no heavy work with strings

4. Algorithmic concatenation of two integers: 45 & 74 -> 4574

This is fast way without using float point functions and stings:

unsigned concatenate(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
    unsigned pow = 10;
    while(y >= pow)
        pow *= 10;
    return x * pow + y;        
}



To compile:
Run msys.bat

Change pwd:
$ cd /c/CProjects/CPPTraining/3

Complile:
$ g++ PPA02.cpp -o PPA02.exe

Run executable:
$ PPA02.exe
